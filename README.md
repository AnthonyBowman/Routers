# Routers
Code for Pi Routers like Megadish and Megadish 4G

Megadish is a wifi router, takes in wifi signal from a distance with a dish and then makes it available by being a wireless access point. Megadish 4G uses a
4G Sim 7600E to collect 4G signal and relay it as a Wifi wireless access point.

Megadish commercial will use and ESP32 probably...
